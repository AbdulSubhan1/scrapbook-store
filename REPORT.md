ABSTARCT:
Online Shopping is a process where the customers can purchase products or services from a seller in real-time, without an interceding service, over the Internet. Online shopping is a type of electronic commerce used for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions [1].The basic idea is to construct an online shopping website for a particular shop where customers can easily browse their desirable products and can purchase them easily using online, without visiting the shop physically.
INTRODUCTION:
The basic purpose behind this project is to construct an online shopping website for a particular shop where the buyer can directly purchase the products from home via internet on mobile or on any system and that provides a comprehensive computerized system, which can collect, capture and analyze data and assess the impact of the program. This website is very useful as it reduces lot of workload for customers as well as owners. Our project is based on a shop that do not have physical storefronts and paper catalogs [1].
Our website is developed using:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JAVASCRIPT
This is a small scale project where a customer access our website and browse through our products and then add the desirable products in add-to-cart. Shopping will be highly personalized and we will provide lower prices than most competitors.
Our website contains the following activities:
•	Enable customers to easily browse through the items or products.
•	Browsing through our website without any registration.
•	Creating a shopping cart so that a customer can add number of items he/she wants to purchase.
•	Can add or delete the selected items from the cart anytime.
Our project has some limitations as well:
•	Lack of delivery feature in our project yet.
•	No Login and no registration of the customer is recorded.
•	It does not give the customer her/his total amount of purchased items.
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The basic concept of this project is to allow the consumer to shop virtually using internet and allow them to buy their desirable items and products from the particular store. This website will be useful to anyone who wants to buy items using internet without visiting the shop.
This website is designed into 2 modules:
•	Customer
•	Administrator

And the end user of this project is the departmental store where the website is hosted on the web and the administrator maintains the database.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
•	INTRODUCTION:
              Analysis is the focus of system developing and is the stage when system designers  have to work at two levels of definition i.e., ”What-to-do” and “How-to-do”.

•	STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:

Nowadays everyone wants to shop virtually to avoid the traffic issues and save their precious time. In the current shopping sites the customer has to first login and then he/she can purchase the goods, but our website is an open platform for anyone who wants to view our products can easily go through them without doing any registration.
                    
      This Online shopping system involves two types of users.
